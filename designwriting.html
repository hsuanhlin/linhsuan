<h1>Why I Became a Designer</h1>

<article>
<p1>Streaming through the shutter with breeze sighing over pages, autumn gleam shades my lean silhouette disappeared into the corner of unrelentingly flat wardrobe. It was in Taiwan in mid-October 2014 after winning in fashion modeling competition for a year. Basked in piles of physic and mathematics papers with a good logic while tracing my future path in mind, I was deemed as one of the brainiest people in my high school but interested in neither of them. "I think I might pick art and design field as my major in university." I can't distinguish between them at that time, the only thing I knew was 'I can work in an aesthetic surroundings'.</p1>

<article>
<p1>I got into the best art school in Taiwan and officially became a so-called 'graphic designer'. Before figuring time to define why designer, I graduated. Meet my mentors in design and here I am-New York. Five years from then-today, I thirst for being a designer-the invisible fluid across disciplines, as a spokesperson/researcher/strategist striving with tools curating the world where rhymed with memories across scales, media, and contexts. Frankly speaking, possessing illustration, fashion and music background leads me to design field, being a designer retrieves my intelligence in logic.</p1>

<h1>Six-Dollar in Cash</h1>

<p1>It's merely six dollars in cash, yet I purchased the world operating in 1/360000 slice of time-the past now. Obscuring tile with a distinction to the counter, I tilted up my head to the beard man in an irregular plaid shirt, screening as if a film noir in late-1950s. I fetched back the noble-pitch-black polypropylene bag-bearing the weight of collective senses with explicit universal knowledge (or let's say experience) presenting through curators' empiric choice, the Sunday New York Times. Ashamed in happiness, I might say it was my first time purchased a newspaper physically, I mean, hold it. 40 sheets of paper double-folded, 120 times of thickness, paradigms of reality in flat spacial-temporal overlapping. It indeed epitomizes the transformation of the value system algorithmically into columns. At that time I purchased, fingers over texts, I, needless to say, immersed in a tactile knowledge with the evidence of black ink on the flank of palm. Torture, zigzag around crenate verge, tap and rhythm with metaphorical agreement. 8.5 points of font in Georgia with a line spacing in 30% height of letters; 45 points in a sans-serif stating its main position. How delicate, compelled and unarmed. Gorging, masticating and ruminating in the angulated replica of reality-radical constructivism.</p1>

<p1>Wonder if we assign proportion of its weights/value-ink/ingredient/assertion/, what is the criterion? Are we able to afford the mass of society? Can we bear the pace of interleaved advancement? Unaligned folding mark and receding pagination accelerate the cycle of newspaper. We module it to align radians of objects we cherish tangibly-elastic shape of newspaper. Collocate its value and transform as daily conversation. We usually chase and purchase knowledge in our lifetime. Yet do not call the production and accessibility of newspaper a 'journey'. It is a manifesto, an actuality that happened before February 2, 2020, it's the trace they preside tomorrow. 'And So It Begins.'</p1>

<p1>Tracing back the birth of newspapers, it dates as early as 202 b.c. in China called ’tipao’ during the Han dynasty; 59 b.c. when Julius Caesar decreed that political happenings, trials and executions should be posted publicly – in piles of hand-written sheets/carved in metal or stone. Widespread of automation and invention of innovated-movable type printing press by Johannes Gutenberg; Linotype machine by Ottmar Mergenthaler, accelerate the mass production of documents (pamphlets/news sheets/news books/news ballads). The revolution in method of knowledge stretched out across Asia then Europe by 1500. The first weekly newspaper was published in Germany by Johann Carolus in 1604, and the first American newspaper was published on the thanksgiving in 1690. Newspaper is the symbol of building trust, authenticity and originality within the public through politics (initially). Its full scope of topics include the construction of news as a cultural practice.</p1>

<p1>10-mile long roll of newsprint paper turn into 30,000 copies of the New York Times in 5 hours. From digital text to tangible silver plates which are made in the room with special yellow lighting that helps protect the plates muted images from exposure. Wrapped in plastic, then delivered with clamp truck directly to newspaper stands and facade of residency place. 12 inches wide by 22 inches long for a folded pages, large commercial dailies expanded six to eight pages with eight to ten columns of text, it maintained its standard since nineteenth century but with a slightly change in width (originally 13.5 in).  “I use pencil and paper to sketch out the page because it is the fastest, most fluid way for me to visualize the interrelation of the various elements and work out an arrangement that will best express the news and our newspaper for that day,” stated Tom Bodkin, the design director of the New York Times. He is interested in their modulation, rhythm and balance, using a schematic is one of the most efficient way for him to sketched out ‘multilayered puzzle’.</p1>

<p1>Newspaper is beyond a ‘paper of record’ contemporarily. The quantity of newspapers in the US hits its peak in 1909 and it’s declined ever since. The way how news spread transformed into medias within technology, however, timing is always a vital factor in the industry. The purpose of news is to report about the past, the present and the future, to convey somebody’s opinion concerning a current event. News must be neutral and unprejudiced as much as possible. It should be based on true facts, participants’ and experts’ opinions, but not on a journalist’s point of view. In searching these information, besides purchasing Sunday New York Times for my weekly research on thesis, I already subscribed an online version for four weeks with $4 dollars.</p1>

<p1>March 1, 2020. As usual, I gaze at each headline clattering off the surface as an onlooker, lingered over titles like 'Mandy Moore Is Ready to Be Heard' or PRADA's campaign 'Play, Records, And, Delete, Apps' or 'Want to See and Hear in New York' with an elegance stretch of couples of ballerina's body, subconsciously skip over all politics pages which usually occupy completely in the first section. I realize that I need not to see all articles in any position as a designer. Reconstruct through its metaphor they showcasing in a way expressively in both words and pictures without being convinced yet as a rationalism in the angle I trust and bear.</p1>

<p1>Newspaper, the reflection of times and society in the celebration of libertarian socialism, sealed in a nation angle, reexamined as a multiculturalism perspective. This reminds me how freedom it is when I first viewed R&B song, Get You, by Daniel Caesar on youtube stream - oversized jeans with a humpbacked body tapping his fingers in air with rows of audiences surrounded; how quirky they present in an unexpected photo (a beard man sitting on bed gorging fried chicken with the caption - in Between Work) as if I notice my niece stuffed her face in the gap of front seat peaking and talking to me with her funny-clown face; how appealing the scene is capturing when encountering piles of books of documentation deposit in a seamless display case in Guggenheim, saying M-Pesa is transforming the way people finance their property with a lack of infrastructure.</p1>

<p1>Titles of articles might driven us to an extreme status. We have the rights gain knowledges and transform them in our point of view. Think of how the arrangement of columns in newspaper affects the sequence we read and how those titles blocking at the first row rendering and exaggerating its content. Furthermore, how technology transforms the way we go through all the big issues - right click for next section, swipe up for details. The hidden part and obvious part fill up the gap how viewers as we do translate - through reading and browsing, we are in-between the flow/section/gap of spatial temporal that creates charm in reality and memory.</p1>
