<p2>Desktop Metaphor and Chess</p2>
<br><p1>Strategy</p1>
<br>
<br><p1>This is a project derives from an initial design writing piece written by me – a piece of design ‘desktop metaphor’ connected to a non-design strategy ‘chess.’ I am always fascinated by value systems and strategies embedded in a well-define visual outcome. I find out the similarities on strategies between these two selected-objects while researching, so that I combine them into an unexpected train journey. The synthesis connects the different segments into a continuous thread – train track sound by Steve Rich and Fantaisie Impromptu piano sound by me, with two voice-over: Siri and I. </p1>

<p1>Design Writing Piece</p1>
<br>
<br><p1>It’s 5:30 a.m. on a lukewarm spring morning. I’m alone in a train cabin traveling to Upstate New York, ready to join a gallery talk held at Dia:Beacon. And then, tap-tap, suddenly I’m not. He looks a little haughty, with chrome yellow glasses, blond hair and dimple on his left cheek, holding an 8" Drueke Gift Magnetic Travel Chess Set with chess clock aside. I’ve never been in a chat I didn’t like. Oh, there was once in Paris where the handles were so close together you could taste your neighbor’s tartiflette. A man standing at the edge of door beckoned me forward for my facebook. That was on a rail as well – what a meeting sublime space. But even these were antidotes to despair, I know I’m about to snap my laptop shut. I respond: Yes.</p1>
<br>
<br><p1>White: Matt</p1>
<br><p1>Black: me</p1>

<br><p1>“Up for chess?” from the designated mate amid choppy locomotive sounds after he follows me into the cabin may or may not betray suspicion. The air is crackling with bizarre; Matt straightens the pawn from the wool moquette fabric with his left-hand pinky finger extending. It used to be that designers were allergic to interface friction and relieved themselves with regrouping modules. As a stand-alone device managing storage, that is why desktop metaphor was invented. The desktop metaphor was first introduced by Alan Kay at Xerox PARC elaborated with a series of software application in 1970, a year after the first message was sent from computer to computer on ARPANET invented by Ray Tomlinson. And a command-line interface popularized by Apple Macintosh in 1984. Turning files into documents in paper paradigm mode, directories into folders, and an amorphous drive into a desktop, we change how we thought about tasks.</p1>

<br><p1>A metaphor of desktop relies on underlying analogy which maps a ”source” to a “target” suggested by Holyoak and Thagard. Fuss through tabs and tabs, just as make ways to check the chess. The bell tinkles. It is Mr. Albert, the train attendant— solid, compact, with his bristly black beard and sloping newsboy cap. Necessary ingredients for a trustworthy train attendant: dampened smile; black beard; elegant last name; humor. The goal is to be both irresistible and invisible. Necessary ingredients for a successful user interface: windows; icons; menus; pointer. Full screen mode may not satisfy any of us, unless you are playing Animal Crossing, or watching Little Women. In the early tiling window manager, overlapping windows are brought to birth on both classics Windows and Mac OS. It calculates relative heights of each window, draws non-overlapping parts, and ensures all windows fit into 100% screen width and height, with three limitations, a) only rectangular window, b) no transparency, and c) draw zoomed window after release mouse press. Simultaneous zoomed window with mouse pressed came to birth after Apple rehired Steve Jobs (NeXTSTEP) to exploit alternatives on Mac OSX by adding Display PostScript and Quartz Extreme for forwarding rendered bitmap between windows and screen.</p1>

<br><p1>The universal redo/undo buttons and trash can icon are the most successful buttons fitting human hesitated needs. The desktop trash, invented by Microsoft, first appeared in Apple's own Lisa computer as a closed, corrugated-looking can icon designed by iconographer Susan Kare in 1983. Afterwards, Apple patented this new feature the “Wastebasket” (if you're in the European Basket), and renamed it as“Trash“ in later versions of Lisa software(if you're in the United States of Trash). Apple added Mission Control for desktop after the invention of Trash Can; Separately, Sun Microsystems played the control center in a 3-D way, users are able to turn the windows backwards to see, just like how we deal with the mystery of the moon. I glance toward Mr. Albert. Under that dampened and lopsided old-man smile, he stretches in a thin triangle at the corner of cabin with one accessorizing Dior oblique brass button-cover about to fall from the ironed Brioni Vanquish suit, glinting across the corridor. Counter to reputation and cosmetics, there is a deep nourishments among beauties. “He is definitely not just a train attendant.” The rumble and sway almost puts me to sleep. Clutching my bag and my book to my chest with my eyes closed for awhile, I can faintly hear Matt’s handset vibrates at his left pocket.</p1>

<br><p1>There is a long silence. I gradually succumb to the mystic languor exhaled by Matt’s hair wax perfume. Somehow, Mr. Albert is sitting beside me. I can’t stop squirming. “Time to get rid of fidgets.” Matt regroups his knight to the center, a mission control center, controlling his six pawns, two rooks, one knight, a queen, and the king. “Relax, relax,” uttered in rhythmic, throaty tones, suggests that Mr. Albert’s discomfort is not unwelcome. </p1>

<br><p1>Alarm goes off like an air-raid siren if the level of testosterone rises too high, a vocal alarm. “Check.” I look straight towards the pieces in front of Matt, from right to left: my bishop, my pawn, my knight, my bishop, and my king. We are born to collect and organize things, but in diverse ways. It is never about what does the chess pieces look like. It is about humans’ satisfaction (Matt’s satisfaction) and acquisition of control among architecture of systems with fluid gestures and own instinct behaviors. So does the desktop metaphor. The idea of getting rid of file names and usual tree-structure introduced by Jef Raskin, the pioneer of the Apple Macintosh project, in 2000. The drop-down list developed by Google in 2004; the hashtag searching engine brought to Twitter by Chris Messina in 2007; the multi-touch Magic Trackpad produced by Apple in 2010; the infinite scroll invented by Aza Raskin but claimed by Hugh Williams for patent issue. The approach driving everything is to lead from human experience rather than any fixed design dogma. </p1>
<br>
<br><p1>Finally, it’s quarter to seven, the train arrives at a nineteen-minute walk distant to Dia:Beacon. I grab my bag around my shoulder, and leave that sudden chess tournament without glancing back. From the corner of my eyes, I see Matt pushes his thick yellow glasses higher on his nose, vanishing in the crowd. So if you ask me how do I deal with that peculiar cabin? I don’t know. The gimmick is that imagine you live in a spy movie. </p1>
