<br><p1>Museum Identities in Museum</p1>
<br>
<br><p1>I am always fascinated with collective identities. Through examining 25 museums’ identities both Europe and United States, I found out that some museums use shapes of architecture as logo (Louvre Abu Dhabi, Casa da Música); some play with iconic and distinguishing typefaces as logo (Museo de Arte Moderno de Buenos Aires, Musée d’Orsay, The Jewish Museum); some make use of color combinations and fixed layout (MoMA); some deal with spiritual theme (Whitney Museum, Haus der Kunst); and some gain inspirations from displayed artwork in the logo (The MET). The biggest distinguishment between museum identity and corporation identity is the former represents a
collective artworks / design works (they are already designed pieces), the latter symbolizes corporation’s value (maybe a design firm, in this case, a design firm’s identity only act for the style of the firm).</p1>

<br><p1>Identity Design</p1>
<br><p1>Exhibition Spatial Design</p1>
<br>
<br><p1>For my thought on the floor plan of Museum Museum, I intend to group museums
through the scale of each museum’s physical covered-area, from smallest to largest, so that when visitors visit my exhibition, they can walk though exhibition by immersive experience. As for an addition event for Museum Museum, I plan to conduct a hands-on workshop for children and teenagers. Ask them to bring 10-15 artworks, art crafts, daily-used objects, written notes, or music pieces to the workshop. And then, ask participants to ‘design’ an identity for their selected-pieces with a brief statement. The form of identity is not restricted and can be created utilizing self creativity.<p1>
