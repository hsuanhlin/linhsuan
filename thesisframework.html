  <p4>Mundane</p4>
  <br><p1>While Mary Douglas, the author of <p5>Purity and Danger</p5>, uses “dirt” as a metaphor for the mundane by referencing “pollution behavior,” as a means of ensuring “that the order in external physical events conforms to the structure of ideas,” Hugh Pickering and Tom Rice in their work <p5>Noise as “sound out of place”: investigating the links between Mary Douglas’ work on dirt and sound studies research</p5>, state that “[t]he ‘sorting’ of perception (and experience) into categories is a human universal, their boundaries are entirely a matter of culture.”</p1>
  <br><br><p1>According to these interpretations, the sorting of perception and experience into categories, whether they be mundane or extraordinary, is fundamentally human. Furthermore, they can be “<p6>anomalous or ambiguous</p6>,” <p5>(Pickering and Rice, 2017)</p5> exist “<p6>in the eye of the beholder</p6>,” and create a “semblance of order,” <p5>(Douglas, 1966)</p5>.</p1>
  <br><br><p1>Jane Jacobs, an American-Canadian journalist and activist, criticizes the relationship between <p6>order and disorder</p6> within modern urban planning in her book <p5>The death and life of great American cities</p5> by illuminating how planners can overlook the social relations that take place in cities by trying to understand how the city should work according to models of their own design, instead of actually looking at how a city functions. She further describes this phenomenon via the metaphor of an “intricate ballet” by which Greenwich Village residents “walk by the center of the stage” towards their school, the taxi’s “morning ritual”, workers that take the same path every day, “character dancers” such as bearded men in motor scooters, hatted drunks or skating teens - till nightfall, when “the ballet goes on under lights, eddying back and forth but intensifying at the bright spotlight pools of Joe’s sidewalk pizza dispensary, the bars, the delicatessen, the restaurant and the drug store” <p5>(Jacobs, 2011)</p5>.</p1>

  <br><p4>Architecture System</p4>
  <br><p1>Daniel Libeskind – The Space of Encounter </p1>
  <br><br><p1>According to Rem Koolhaas in his book, <p5>Delirious New York: A Retroactive Manifesto for Manhattan</p5>, he asserts that <p6>the primary intent of architecture must include all the performative activities of human occupants within a space</p6> <p5>(Koolhaas, 1994)</p5>.</p1>
  <br><br><p1>In the book <p5>Inside the White Cube</p5>, postmodernism is framed by un-neutral modern gallery space, inwhich there is a “presence before a work of art” whereas “we absent ourselves in favor of the Eye and the Spectator.” Location is a key word. It telescopes concerns about where (space) and how (perception) <p5>(Doherty, 1986)</p5>.</p1>

  <br><p4>Dance System</p4>
  <br><p1>Merce Cunningham, an American dance artist, uses <p6>chance and randomness</p6> as a creative tool in dance strategies.<p1>
