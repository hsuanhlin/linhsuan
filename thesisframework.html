  <p4>Mundane</p4>
  <br><p1>Dirt, regarding as the matter out of space, is defined by the anthropologist Mary Douglas with two important conditions: “a set of ordered relations and a contravention of that order”</p1> <p5>(Douglas, 1966).</p5> <p1>Dirt is a “residual category [of things] rejected from our normal scheme of classifications”. It is a label for “all events which blur, smudge, contradict or otherwise confuse accepted classifications”</p1> <p5>(Douglas, 1968).</p5> <p1>The sorting of perception and experience into categories is a human universal, the in-between boundaries are entirely a matter of culture. The same definition comes to noise – sound out of place. Both dirt and noise are anomalous or ambiguous, and are implied in the eye/ear of the beholder. They varied between singularity and multiplicity.
  <br><br><p1>In 18th century, Jane Austen, an English novelist, focuses on the mastery of the mundane by asserting "Everything was so unbearably banal" in the book Emma.
  <br><br><p1>In 2006, Carol Wical, the author of the paper Matter out of Place: ‘New Materialism’, suggested that dirt has a function in cultural constructions of gender and that action films featuring a female protagonist provide a fertile site for investigation. </p1>
  <br><br><p1>In 2011, Jane Jacobs, an American-Canadian journalist and activist, argues the relationship between order and disorder on modern urban planning in the book The death and life of great American cities by stating humans overlooking the social relations. She narrates an “intricate ballet” <p5>(Jacobs, 2011)</p5> that takes place in her Greenwich Village street’s sidewalk. </p1> <p1>“Diversity is a small scale phenomenon. It requires collections of little plans.”</p1> <p5>(Jacobs, 1981).</p5>
  <br><br>
  <br><p4>Architecture System</p4>
  <br><p1>Daniel Libeskind – The Space of Encounter </p1>
  <br><br><p1>In his book Delirious New York : A Retroactive Manifesto for Manhattan, Rem Koolhaas asserts the importance of a constructed space. A primary intent of architecture, to combine maximum density with maximum of light and space, must include all the performative activities of human occupants. Spaces isolate individual particles floating weightlessly through a magnetic field of fabricated pleasure, occasionally colliding – abstracted, formalized emotions of sufficient density</p1> <p5>(Koolhaas, 1994).</p5>
  <br><br><p1>In the book Inside the White Cube, postmodernism is framed by un-neutral modern gallery space, which is “presence before a work of art that we absent ourselves in favor of the Eye and the Spectator.” It is concerned about where (space) and how (perception) – between physical (out there) and physiological (internal)</p1> <p5>(Doherty 1986).</p5>
  <br><br>
  <br><p4>Dance System</p4>
  <br><p1>Merce Cunningham, an American dance artist, use chance and randomness as a creative tool in dance strategies. His technique emphasizes clarity of form, coordination of torso and legwork, rhythmic accuracy, spatial awareness and virtuosity.<p1>
  <br><br><p1>In 2014, Nikolaus Gansterer explores Merce Cunningham’s and John Cage’s collaboration on the piece "Cheap Imitation / Second Hand" (1947–1977) on the work Third Hand, and creates a series of re-interpretations of one of the artists’ key works, translating it into a spatial series of sketching arrangements.</p1>

  <br><p4>Visual Activism</p4>
  <br><p1>Mikael Colville-Andersen – Canadian-Danish filmmaker, urbanist, designer, author, and inspirational speaker.</p1>
