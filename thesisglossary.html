  <p6>Behavior</p6>
  <br><p1>"The way in which someone conducts oneself or behaves; the manner of conducting, or the way in which something functions or operates" <p5>(Merriam-Webster)</p5>.</p1>
  <br><p1>I reference behavior as evidence of the reciprocal relationship or collision between human elements.</p1>
  <br><br>
  <br><p6>Boundary</p6>
  <br><p1>"Something that indicates or fixes a limit or extent" <p5>(Merriam-Webster)</p5>.</p1>
  <br><p1>I reference boundaries as the dichotomy of human elements. More specifically, this dichotomy refers to cultural, social, and political disparities in society.</p1>
  <br><br>
  <br><p6>Causality</p6>
  <br><p1>"The relationship between cause and effect; the principle that everything has a cause" <p5>(Oxford Dictionary)</p5>.</p1>
  <br><p1>I reference casualty as an uncertain and unexpected transitional framework in the present that instantly combines temporal and spatial elements.</p1>
  <br><br>
  <br><p6>Interplay</p6>
  <br><p1>"The effect that two or more things have on each other; the action between two or more things or the effect they have on each other" <p5>(Cambridge Dictionary)</p5>.</p1>
  <br><p1>I reference interplay as a reciprocal relationship or collision between elements within certain embedded human systems.<p1>
  <br><br>
  <br><p6>Mundane</p6>
  <br><p1>"Of, relating to, or characteristic of the world"<p5>(Merriam Webster)</p5>. "Very ordinary and therefore not interesting" <p5>(Cambridge Dictionary)</p5>.</p1>
  <br><p1>I reference the mundane as repetitive, structured phenomena, but also the foundation of everything. It is "the key to seeing things in a new way" <p5>(Harry West, the principal of Invisible Design)</p5>.</p1>
  <br><br>
  <br><p6>Perception</p6>
  <br><p1>"A belief or opinion, often held by many people and based on how things seem, or the quality of being aware of things through the physical senses, especially sight" <p5>(Cambridge Dictionary)</p5>.</p1>
  <br><p1>I reference perception as the interplay and individuality of worldviews between and amongst human particles. </p1>
  <br><br>
  <br><p6>Sociology</p6>
  <br><p1>"The science of society, social institutions, and social relationships. Specifically: the systematic study of the development, structure, interaction, and collective behavior of organized groups of human beings; the scientific analysis of a social institution as a functioning whole and as it relates to the rest of society” <p5>(Merriam-Webster)</p5>.</p1>
  <br><p1>I reference sociology as the collective multiplicity of humanizing traits and characteristics that constitute society.</p1>
  <br><br>
  <br><p6>System</p6>
  <br><p1>"A regularly interacting or interdependent group of items forming a unified whole a number system; an organized set of doctrines, ideas, or principles usually intended to explain the arrangement or working of a systematic whole the Newtonian system of mechanics" <p5>(Merriam-Webster)</p5>.</p1>
  <br><p1>I refer systems as algorithmic solutions that support the evidence of visual patterns, which are formed by organized and interdependent societal principles.<p1>
  <br><br>
  <br><p6>Visual Activism</p6>
  <br><p1>I refer to a visual activism as the proactive trigger and effect of the relationship between activists practices and contemporary visual culture.<p1>
